# youtube-mp3-split
Split large mixtapes from Youtube by their timestamps

## Prerequisite

1. Python 2.7
2. FFMPEG
3. youtube-dl (Optional)

## How to use

The best way to use it would be to use the following sample

1. Download the `.mp3` of a Youtube video. The best way to download would be to use `youtube-dl`

	`youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRh1cZbwc4M`

2. Remove the spaces of the downloaded file. This can be easily fixed. Say the new name of the downloaded file is `big_file.mp3`
3. Copy the time stamp details from the "Details" section of the video or from the comments
4. **CRUCIAL PART** - Create a time stamp file in a `.csv` file format with separator as `|`. I have supplied a sample time stamp file for the above URL. The name of the file is `song_list`. Make sure to create a NULL row as shown in the sample file. The NULL row denotes when the song ends. If you don't create this row, the last song won't be created.
5. Move `big_file.mp3` and `time_split.py` in `sample_run`
6. Use my script

	`python time_split.py song_list big_file.mp3 "Martin O'Donnell,Michael Salvatori" "Halo: Reach OST"`

7. All `.mp3`s will be generated by `FFMPEG`

## Disclaimer

This is a very basic first attempt at creating such a script. There might be bugs and un-handled exceptions ;_;
